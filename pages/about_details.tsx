      Kaduna Markets Development and Management Company (KMDMC) continues to report
            increasing IGR performance despite the Covid-19 pandemic. From an average revenue
            performance of 90.7% in previous years to a record high of 118% in 2019 and 109.5% in 2020.
            The company projects upwards of 2000% boost at the end of 2021, with projects like the
            sale of shops at Sheikh Abubakar Mahmoud Gumi Market, Kasuwan Magani, lease of
            Galaxy Mall, and sale of other built Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects nearing
            completion. In the first half of 2021, the company had already achieved a record breaking
            revenue of over 400m, surpassing total annual revenue in any preceeding year.
            In early 2020, the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) struck, plummeting all countries into
            uncertainty. The pandemic posed immense threats to healthcare economic systems and
            spurred a global shutdown of economic and social activities.

      <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-10">
      Nonetheless, KMDMC has been at the forefront of the Kaduna State response from the Government
            to the pandemic, deploying practical solutions that consider public health interest and
            commercial activities. Following the reopening of the State, we immediately commenced
            plans for receiving applications for the Sale of Shops at SAMG Market from traders with the
            right of first refusal.
            We have processed 7349 shop applications for the available 6,546 shops in the market out of
            which 4,673 have been allocated. Including Tax Clearance Certificate as a requirement for
            application contributed an estimated N85,635,000.00 to KADIRS Tax Clearance collections in
            2020/2021 and we have facilitated the registration of over 20,000 traders for the state
            residency card.

      Verification of previous occupiers of markets like Kasuwan Bacci, Sabon Gari, Kawo Market,
            Kabala Market, Ungwan Rimi, and Kasuwan Magani has commenced in all markets under
            development. We have completed the 450 capacity parking lot at Sheikh Abubakar Gumi
            Market and converted the old KASUPDA building to a GSM Village; both facilities are now in
            use. We have sold out all 77 shops at Shops 54 and 56 Neighborhood Centres.
            Concurrently, our Project team is looking at safety measures- including global best practices
            and have reviewed our Development Lease Agreements to ensure a culture of maintenance
            and sustainability. We have plans to concession facilities like the Murtala Mohammed
            Square, Trailer Parks at Mararaban Jos, Tafa and the Green Agro Allied Industrial Zone
